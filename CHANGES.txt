Version 1.2.0 (??/??/2007)
-------------------------

- Feature: Added new field "promptChoiceField" to the "All Widgets" demo
  demonstrating the prompt message of the select widget.

- Feature: Increased the integer default value of "All Widgets" demo to show
  off our new internationalized converter.

- Feature: Made ``bytesField`` and ``passwordField`` non-required, since they
  do not show their default values prohibiting the form to successfully
  submit, which can be annoying when playing around.

- Feature: New "Questionnaire" demo shows how to use groups effectively. It
  also demonstrates how the label of buttons and widgets can be changed using
  attribute value adapters.


Version 1.1.2 (6/25/2007)
-------------------------

- Bug: Provide ``optionalChoice`` field in the content type. Pre-1.3.0
  releases of ``z3c.form`` simply ignored missing fields, but the latest
  version reports the error. Thanks to Luke Miller for the report.


Version 1.1.1 (6/24/2007)
-------------------------

- Bug: Add new ``zope.rdb`` dependency to the setup and buildout
  configuration.


Version 1.1.0 (6/22/2007)
-------------------------

- Feature: New "SQL Message" demo shows how ``z3c.form`` can be used with
  non-object data. Specificically, this small application demonstrates using a
  Gadfly database using pure SQL calls without any ORM.

- Feature: New "Address Book" demo that demonstrates more complex use cases,
  such as subforms, composite widgets, and mappings/lists


Version 1.0.0 (5/24/2007)
-------------------------

- Initial Release
