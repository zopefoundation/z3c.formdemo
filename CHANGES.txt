  demonstrating the prompt message of the select widget.

- Feature: Increased the integer default value of "All Widgets" demo to show
  off our new internationalized converter.

  do not show their default values prohibiting the form to successfully
  submit, which can be annoying when playing around.

  also demonstrates how the label of buttons and widgets can be changed using
  attribute value adapters.


Version 1.1.2 (2007-06-25)

- Feature: New "SQL Message" demo shows how ``z3c.form`` can be used with
  non-object data. Specificically, this small application demonstrates using a
  Gadfly database using pure SQL calls without any ORM.

- Feature: New "Address Book" demo that demonstrates more complex use cases,
  such as subforms, composite widgets, and mappings/lists


Version 1.0.0 (2007-05-24)
